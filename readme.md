# My Advent of Code 2024 solutions

Written in Golang for fun and profit!

Still in a very rough state (especially as far as the CLI command is concerned).

To run a particular day's solutions, first include your puzzle input inside the respecive day's folder with the name `puzzle.input`. Then run:

```bash
go build . # produces an executable: advent2024
./advent2024 <day> <problem>
```

For example: For day 1 the input could be `"1, 2, 3"`, I would store that inside the file `./day01/puzzle.input`, and then I would execute `./advent2024 1 1`
